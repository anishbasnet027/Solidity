Integers can be split into main groups: regular integers (can store both positive and negative values) and unsigned integers (can only store values that are 0 or higher)

Regular integer has keywords from int8 to int256. The number signifies the maximum number of bits it can store (thus limiting the maximum value), and it can be any number between 8 and 256 as long as it incremented in steps of 8 (e.g., int16 is valid but int17 is not). The int keyword alone would be understood as int256.

Unsigned integers follow the same logic. The only difference is the keyword which ranges from uint8 to uint256. Keyword uint can also be used instead of uint256.
